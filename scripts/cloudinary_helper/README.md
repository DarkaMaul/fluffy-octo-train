# Cloudinary Helper

The script in this folder implements various methods to deal with Cloudinary API.
Cloudinary is an image CDN with a generous free tier. It is used in the blog to serve image with optimized sizes and thus reduce loading times.

To give an example, I was able to reduce the food page size from a few MB to 500 kb.

## Installation

In a Python3 (tested with Python3.10) environment, install the requirements listed in requirements.txt.

## Usage

I think it's better to read the code directly and adapt the methods to your needs. I don't think anyone can use it directly in another context that this blog.
