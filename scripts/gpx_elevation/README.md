# Elevations Helper

The script in this folder computes the elevation on a GPX file using Google Maps Elevation API.

## WARNING

The Google Maps Elevation API has a cost, only the first requests are free. Use the script with caution if you don't want to get billed thousands of dollars.

## Installation

In a Python3 (tested with Python3.10) environment, install the requirements listed in requirements.txt.

## Usage

Simply add the Google Maps API Key in the corresponding variable and use an interactive interpreter to call the functions. Note that they are tailored for my needs and you need probably to change them.

## Shoutouts

This script was co-written by ChatGPT, and it provided a nice help to understand how to use the API. However, I did not manage to get completely correct code and I had to rewrite it partially.
