# So you wanna hike the GPT (beginner edition)

## Intro

Have you heard of the Greater Patagonian Trail (GPT) ? It's gaining popularity as one of the world's longest and most beautiful hikes. The main reference for the GPT are the GPT manual and Wikiexplora, which provide detailed information about the trail. As inexperienced hikers, we'd like to share our personal experience on the GPT, specifically the sections we hiked during the 2022-23 season. It's worth noting that this is just our own perspective and should be taken as such.

## About Us

We are a French couple, Alexis (28) and Iris (29), taking a sabbatical year in South America. While Alexis quit his job prior to leaving, Iris took advantage of a French law that allows up to 11 months of unpaid leave. Both of us love hiking and camping, but the GPT was our first experience with trekking. We were not experts on the subject and likely made some mistakes along the way. Fortunately, we completed our hikes without any injuries or major mishaps.
