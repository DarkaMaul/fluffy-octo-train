## Iris & Alexis

We are a French couple doing a sabbatical year in South America. While we both like to hike, before starting the GPT, we never did trekking before, and hence we consider ourselves beginners.

You can contact us by sending an email at [contact·@·walkgpt.fr](mailto:contact@walkgpt.fr).
