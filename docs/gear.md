    The following page lists the content of our bags. We are neither affiliated nor endorsing the items we used.

## Preparation

Filling our bags was a big part of our preparation for the GPT. During thru-hikes any item in the backpack need to be carried until the end. Hence, every gram counted and we aimed for light backpacks. We extensively used the french forum [randonnee-leger](https://www.randonner-leger.org/forum/), an online community of ultra light backpackers. While they sometimes make choices we were not ready to do, the forum is an information goldmine on light gear.

We did test our gear in November 2022 before our departure by doing a two days hike in the Fontainebleau forest with friends. Even a short hike like this one helped us to learn a lot on our gear, and adjusted our backpacks afterwards (e.g. we changed the sleeping pads for warmer ones).

## Gear Details

### Common gear

#### The tent (Durston X Mid 2P )

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Our home for the GPT and our adventures onwards, and a truely amazing one. It was lightweight, and with absurd amount of spaces inside. Too bad the fabric was torn a bit in Puerto Natales due to the heavy winds... But it is easy to stick a patch and we still continued to use it (see below)

#### The cooking pot

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Light and resistant to firewood (it even spent hours in a firepit to cook pi√±ones). If too hot, we used our Buffs to handle it.

#### Sporks

+ **Our rating**: 4/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Great but too big to fit inside the pot: :(

#### Heater (FireMaple 117t)

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Light and stable.

#### Knife (Victorinox Ambassador)

+ **Our rating**: 4/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Lightweight, with useful scisors.

#### Filtering system (Sawyer MicroSqueeze with the bottle)

+ **Our rating**: 3/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes but with another bottle

We have mixed feelings with those. We used them extensively and they never failed us. But the waterflow tends to be really small after a couple of use and it is annoying. And if the bottle used is not flexible, it is very hard to squeeze.

#### Electricity

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Details:
- A two port USB-C charger (Anker Nano 521)
- Two 30cm USB-C to USB-C cables
- A USB-C to MicroSD adaptor
- A USB-C to MiniUSB adaptor
- A USB-C to Lighting adaptor
- A spare MicroSD card
- Air Pod Pro 2
- Sony Linkbuds
- Amazon Kindle (x2)

While the setup was not useful during hikes, we loved it in places with plugs. It was both lightweight and convenient. One problem however is that it is impossible to retrieve the tracks from the GPS (Garmin) without a MicroUSB adaptor (we wished we had brought it).

Finally, having earphones with noise cancellation was awesome during the long hours of transportation. And our ebook readers were a nice addition for the evening in the tent.

#### Headlights

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

As the days are really long in December in Patagonia, we did not use them at this time. But they proved very useful for our nights ascents. And they are lightweight.

#### Towel

+ **Our rating**: 3/5
+ **Would bring back again**: no

We had a love/hate relationship with our towel. While really ultralight, it was difficult to use because it started to stink very fast. Since it was eaten by a cow, we used our day tee-shirts to dry ourselves and that was sufficient.

### Alexis' gear

#### Sleeping Bag

+ **Our rating**: 4/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

I really like my sleeping bag, its only problem is that it lost some of its fluffyness super fast...

#### Sleeping matress

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Light and warm! And way better than any other alternative.



### Iris' gear

#### Sleeping Bag

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Warm and compact, I fought it was perfectly adapted to the GPT weather.

#### Sleeping matress

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Light, comfy, warm!

#### Backpack eja 48

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Light, comfy and great volume. The only downside is the front belly pockets are a bit just to fit the phone.

#### Hiking pant quechua convertible

+ **Our rating**: 5/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

Light, not too dark so does not attract too much tabanos. It proved resistant all along the trek. I neverused it in its shorts version during the trek.

#### Socks sealskinz

+ **Our rating**: 4/5
+ **Would bring back again**: yes

These socks are expensive but I liked to have them as they keep your feet dry for most river crossings. Once wet they are long to dry but the inner part can dry overnight. The problem is that if holes appears in it, the water gets stuck with your feet... so you asolutely need to replace them.

## Gear modifications during the trip

### Replacing gear on the GPT

After being used extensively, our gear started to get a bit worn out and need to be replaced. As the region is a trekking paradise, finding gear is relatively easy in one of the multiple shop. However, we did not manage to find exactly what we were looking for. 

On the GPT, we mostly encountred these brands:
* Doite: chilean brand selling camping gear, usually not suitable for light backpackers.
* Lippi: chilean brand selling treking gear, a nice quality/price ratio.
* Andesgear: chilean brand, a bit more expensive than Lippi but with higher end options.
* Decathlon: only near Santiago, but with a different selection that we found in France.

On our trip, we had to replace:

* Our hiking shoes (for Iris and Alexis): we found the exact same model at Andesgear in Temuco.
* Socks: we bought some from Lippi and Andesgear.
* Tee Shirts: Alexis trail tee-shirt got destroyed fast by the thorny plants of the trails. Its color (black) also attracted the tabanos, so he replaced it by a yellow one from Lippi.
* Sleeping pad: Iris Thermarest had an issue and needed to be replaced. We did not find the same weight to r-value option and ended up with an Andesgear model which was heavier and colder.

### Tent

We left France with a brand new X-Mid 2P tent, a rather expensive but light tent using hiking poles for the structure. However, it did not support the heavy winds in our camping in Puerto Natales and we created some holes in the fly. Since we had our tickets for Torres for the next day, we decided to buy a new one in the town, and ended up with a TODO. This new tent was heavier, but wind resistant and supported the difficult conditions of Grande Paine without problem. Its only problem was that the space inside the tent was really small, way less than the XMid. We ended up carrying the two tents until Cochrane where we decided to send the new one in France, and to keep the X-Mid with some duck tape, more guylines, and the pegs from the new one.

Our repairs worked well and we finished our GPT hike with the tent without any further problem!

### Camp shoes

As the trail sometimes cross streams and we did not want to take off our shoes for them, we finished some days with wet shoes and feets. For our first hike, we used our home made vibram shoes. However, we did not find a way to have them stick enough to the feets, so they were useless (and somehow dangerous). We throw them away in Torres del Paine. For the next weeks, we had no camp shoes which was rather unconfortable. We managed to find some light options in Villa O'Higgins, and finished our hike with them.

## Additions

If we liked our initial list, we did some additions to our backpacks during our hike:

* A pan that served both in town campings to cook meat and during the hikes as a second plate. We found by chance a NatureHike one in a shop called The Mate Paradise in TODO.
* An external power bank for the stretch 12-9. We did not know how long we would stay on the trail and decided to buy a 10000mA power bank in case we had a problem with the GPS.
