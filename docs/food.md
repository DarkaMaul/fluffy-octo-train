# Food

The food on the trail was a really important topic for us, and the one we learned the most during our hike. Indeed, we started with really low calories rations and ended up being hungry almost all the time and losing lot of weight in the first few weeks. Following Piia and Oliver example, we started to count calories and did our groceries with this food-math in mind. This was a bit complicated at first, but then, we developped sort of a habit and at the end, we knew the ballparks numbers of calories/100g of many of our typical food items.

Our menus were trying to reach :
* 2,800 kcal/day for Alexis
* 2,100 kcal/day for Iris

A typical day on the trail was with 5 meals every 2h/2h30:

* Breakfast - hot or cold ;
* Morning Snack - cold ;
* Lunch - cold ;
* Afternoon snack - cold ;
* Dinner - hot.

## Trail menu

### Breakfast

* **When**: just before leaving, after packing everything.
* **What**: We had two different types:
    * Instant avena with desydrathed soup (pollo was the favorite!), slighty cooked.
    * Museli with milo (powder cacao) and cold water or powder milk.
* **Alexis' bonus**: Harina tostada with cinamon.
* **Calorie count**:
    * Alexis: 530
    * Iris: 330

### Morning Snack

* **When**: Usually after 2h/2h30 of walking or when one of us was feeling hungry
* **What**: Cereals bars. There are multiple types in Chile, bust it is hard to find the same ones. Our favorite were the NatureValley, but we also loved Soul and Protein. However, the most available ones were the Quakkers, not super tasty. To reach the expected calorie count, sometines we had to take 2 or 3 bars for a single break.
* **Alexis' bonus**: None.
* **Calorie count**: 
    * Alexis: 200
    * Iris: 200

### Lunch

* **When**: Between 12 and 14, usually 2-2h30 after the snack.
* **What**: 
    * One tortilla with peanut butter
    * One tortilla with a chocolate/chestnut spread
* **Alexis' bonus**: Another tortilla with peanut butter
* **Calorie count**: 
    * Alexis: 700
    * Iris: 510

### Afternoon Snack

* **When**: In the middle of the afternoon. For shorter hiking day, this was skipped.
* **What**: Homemade trail mix. Our best combination was:
    - Peanuts with merken
    - Japaneese peanuts
    - Chestnut
    - Almonds
* **Alexis' bonus**: Speculos
* **Calorie count**: 
    * Alexis: 460
    * Iris: 250

### Dinner

* **When**: Before going to sleep.
* **What**: We alternated between few different options.  
    * *Puree de papas* with desydrathed soup
    * Polenta with spices or desydrathed soup
    * Semola with spices or desydrathed soup
    
    We often added soy meat (_carne de soja_) for proteins and crispy onions for the taste.
    Finally, a desert (usually a cookie)!

* **Alexis' bonus**: Extra ration of soy meat.
* **Calorie count**: 
    * Alexis: 950
    * Iris: 850

## Extras

For shorter sections (like 19 or 16), we also carried vegetables to improve our daily meals (such as carotts for the tortillas, or avocados for the breakfast). A fresh version (but with less calories) of the lunch break was a tortilla with boiled eggs, carrots, red cabbage and hummus.

Our alimentation lacked some vitamins, so we also took some supplements to limit our carences. And in towns, we would often buy lot of vegetables and eat big salads to compensate.

## Harvesting food

Jan says it better in the manual but we managed to harvest food on the trail, either directly from the nature, or simply by buying it to the local. We were spoiled because we hiked in the Auraucania region when the pi√±ones were ripe, and ate plenty of those (we cooked them in open fires to save our gas). This allowed us to extend our reserves, and to do the 12-9 stretch in one go.

## Spices

To improve our meals, we usually carried some spices:

* salt
* pepper
* curry or curcuma
* merken
* garlic
* canella

Along our olive oil, this allowed to make every meal a bit tastier!
