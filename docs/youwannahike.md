# So you wanna hike the GPT (beginner edition)

## Intro

We may have heard about the Greater Patagonian Trail (GPT) online, through a list of the world longest thru-hikes or anywhere else... The references for the GPT are the manual and the Wikiexplora which provide very complete and clear documentation of this "trail". However in this text, we would like to relate our experience with the trail as inexperienced hikers. This will only tell our point of view, only for the sections we hiked, and during the 2022-23 season.

< REMOVE? We would be glad if it can help you figure out if the GPT fits you.

### Us

We are a French couple (Alexis 28 and Iris 29) doing a sabbatical year in South America. While Alexis left his job before leaving, Iris used a French law that allows a break of up to 11 months without pay. We both really enjoy hiking and camping, but the GPT is our first experience doing thru-hikes together. We were (and still not are) experts on the subject, and we probably made mistakes. Fortunately, we finished our hikes without injuries or major fears!

## The Manual

This 1,000 page long PDF document has tremendously helped us during our GPT hike. We not only read it before leaving to help us plan our hike and understand what to pack, but also during the hike. To be noted, most our trail-discoveries were actually already present in the manual (for example, we discovered that crispy onions make a really tasty and light addition to most our trails meals, but that was already written in the manual). We often joked as referring to the manual as "Our Bible", but we cannot understate how usefull it has been to us.

## Before leaving

### Getting the tracks
You cannot hike the GPT without its GPX tracks. While we met a hiker on GPT16 only using the inaccurate version published online on Wikiloc, we would have felt really unconfortable doing so. Indeed, he had no idea where to find water on this desertic section.

So you need to ask the track from Jan following the instructions in the manual. And then, if he has the time, you get the chance to have a chat with him. Something we did not measure at this time is that Jan has a lot of experience hiking in Patagonia and his advices are coming from years of practice. So, we think it is a great idea to listen to them, we did not regret it!

### Planning

The GPT is not a trail but a network of trails. It is divided in about 90 sections (in 2023) on a bit more than 5,000km. So it's hard/dangerous to hike in a single season. Hence, you have to pick parts of the trails.
We left home without having a plan really well defined because we had troubles evaluating what we were capable of hiking. We only knew we wanted to start with GPT67, and then see what was next. Our idea was to start from the most southern part of the contient and then mostly head towards north.

### Gear List

Something that was very important for us before leaving was to have an optimised gear list (and we became a bit obsessed with that). We knew we would have to carry our backpacks everyday, and thus we wanted something close to ultralight. However, as those backpacks had to be used for a complete year, we had to compromise for some items (the earphones are not needed for the hike per se but are a really nice addition for the long buses and flights).

In retrospective, we used all our items and were pretty happy with the content of our backpacks. Having lightweights backpacks allowed us to carry up to 12 days of food for the longer stretchs which was super nice!

We describe more in details our gear list in this page (TODO)

## In South America

### Bus

### Ressuply

Our ressuply strategy was different in the South and the North. South of Puerto Montt, we only found smaller supermarket (Unimarc was the biggest chain), 


### Housing (iOverlander)

Finding a camping spot on the trail is not difficult. Indeed, Jan (and the other contributors) made a tremendous work and the tracks are filled with Camp/Camp NO water points which are suitable for camping. Of note, they do not represent all the possible locations for camping. In the trail towns, it is a bit more difficult to find an appropriate camping spot. We used the collaborative application iOverlander that lists some spots, either for vans/campers or simply tents, with some success.


### Carabineros

The carabineros are also a highlight of our trip. For some sections, the registration was mandatory (GPT67 for instance), but for other we spontanously went to greet them. They know well the cordilleras and could give us valuable advices on the path. More importantly, they were also extremly friendly with us, offered us to refill our bottles and gave us advices on appropriate camping spots in the small town of the trip. Thus, we were positively surprised with their behavior!

### Navigation

As highlighted in the manual, the navigation on the GPT can be challenging. We were used of the European (French) trails with regular marks and hard-to-miss paths. On the GPT, some sections part are not as easy. While it can be fun sometimes (we loved on GPT19 to run over the dunes trying to follow some directions on the GPS), it was also mentally exhausting to check over and over the GPS to find the appropriate direction or to understand where the track is trying to go. Our worst experience are not when no trail exist, but when you have about a dozen options and you don't know if you should stick to the track or go with the flow.

### Speaking Spanish

During our hike on the GPT, we did not encounter many (if any) english speakers. If Iris followed some Spanish lessons during her studies, Alexis never learned the language. This language barrier was hard to overcome and he felt he missed something. Indeed, every interactions with the locals, which are true highlights of the hikes, were really limited on his side. Especially with the somewhat stronger accents in the South. In retrospective, we wished we had improved our Spanish level before leaving to enjoy our hike even more.
