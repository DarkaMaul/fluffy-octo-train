# The Hike

!!! note "Disclaimer"

    This page simply relates our experience on the section we hiked. For up to date informations, the Wikiexplora and the Manual are much better sources.

??? example "Data sources"
    All distances measures are from our Garmin Etrex 32X tracks, but the elevation numbers were computed using the Google Elevation API.







## GPT67

* **Name**: GPT67
* **Length**: 81 km
* **Elevation**: 4036 m D+ / 3857 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 28 h

Our first hike in the GPT, the most southern hike of the world! Also one of the hike we struggled the most and had to change our plans because we could not progress on the terrain. This loop is rather known, but the GPT RR takes a slightly longer option by going with the Lago Winhound (TODO), which is not maintained and was very challenging. There is also a steep descent in the scree at the end we found really scarry, but were lucky because we saw a couple of hikers doing it just before us.
Overall, super views and landscapes!

## GPT45

* **Name**: GPT45
* **Length**: 85 km
* **Elevation**: 2401 m D+ / 2402 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 20 h

Hiking in Torres del Paine requires more planification that we had, so we only found space in one camping there. We thus hiked part of the W-trek as day-trips, returning to our camping everynight. This park is really beautiful, but a bit overrun.

## GPT40

* **Name**: GPT40
* **Length**: 67 km
* **Elevation**: 2808 m D+ / 2795 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 19 h

This section is also known as the Huemul Circuit. This 4-day loop is rather challenging, and we had our most scarry moment of the GPT at the Paso del Viento. However, it is really unique and combine a walk on a glacier, some tyroleans, glaciers views, steep forests... We found the hike to be really difficult and we struggled a lot, but we enjoyed it a lot. The last day is a bit less rewarding as the final kilometers are in an endless field, and then on a road.

## GPT39

* **Name**: GPT39
* **Length**: 61 km
* **Elevation**: 1589 m D+ / 1471 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 13 h

Our first real thru-hikes as the previous hikes were loops. This is also the best attractivity/difficulty ratio of the GPT with a stunning 5/1. While we were definitely not alone (we camped with hundred of other tents), the hike was really beautiful and indeed, extremely easy. We climbed up to Lago Dos Tres for the evening, which allowed us to avoid the crowd and reward us with beautiful evening lights over the Fitz Roy at the lake (where we brushed our teeths!).

## GPT38

* **Name**: GPT38
* **Length**: 49 km
* **Elevation**: 1818 m D+ / 2015 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 15 h


This hike in the no-man lands between Argentina and Chile was great and was the first one we met almost nobody (we just saw a single tent in 4 days). Truely remote, not super difficult and with a great diversity of landscapes.

## GPT37

* **Name**: GPT37
* **Length**: 68 km
* **Elevation**: 3150 m D+ / 3128 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 20 h

Instead of doing the full section, we opted for the West Traverse and arranged a bot transfer to Bahia Pescada. Then, we started hiking north until Villa O'Higgins, We met exactly 0 other humans being in these 4 days, and hiked on barely hiked trails. Eventhough the navigation was sometimes challengin, this was a really great experience.

## GPT32

* **Name**: GPT32
* **Length**: 55 km
* **Elevation**: 2893 m D+ / 2451 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 15 h

We did only a part of the 32, also known as La Horquetas, in the National Park Cerro Castillo. While the entrance is expensive, the hike in itself is rather nice and diverse, We also enjoyed going up to the different lakes.

## GPT19

* **Name**: GPT19
* **Length**: 57 km
* **Elevation**: 3005 m D+ / 2834 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 17 h

One of our favorite hike of the GPT, truely an amazing one. That was also our first ascencion of a volcan and we were rewarded with stunning views on the crater. Then, a day walking without paths in the middles of dunes without shade or water, running when going down and struggling when going up. To be rewarded with a hot river at the end where we met a group of tourists that invited us to share their campfire. And a final day in a foggy forest that achieved an impressive diversity of landscapes.

## GPT16

* **Name**: GPT16
* **Length**: 50 km
* **Elevation**: 2404 m D+ / 2149 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 13 h


## GPT12
* **Name**: GPT12
* **Length**: 103 km
* **Elevation**: 4590 m D+ / 4235 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 28 h
## GPT11
* **Name**: GPT11
* **Length**: 34 km
* **Elevation**: 1342 m D+ / 1776 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 9 h

## GPT10
* **Name**: GPT10
* **Length**: 52 km
* **Elevation**: 1549 m D+ / 1546 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 11 h

## GPT09
* **Name**: GPT09
* **Length**: 71 km
* **Elevation**: 3058 m D+ / 3181 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 18 h

## GPT08

* **Name**: GPT08
* **Length**: 117 km
* **Elevation**: 5990 m D+ / 5090 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 30 h

## GPT06

* **Name**: GPT06
* **Length**: 92 km
* **Elevation**: 5534 m D+ / 5824 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 26 h

## Ruta Tantauco

* **Name**: RT
* **Length**: 96 km
* **Elevation**: 1290 m D+ / 1450 m D-
* **Hiking time**: 27 h

Because of the fires, we had to do a small break in our GPT exploration. After looking at alternatives, we decided to visit Chiloe and hike in the (private) Parque Tantauco. This trail of 94km in the wetland of Chiloe was beautiful, and not like any other sections of the GPT. First, it had a lot of infrastructures on the trail, a refugio with a stove everynight, and a mark every 50m with the actual kilometers count. As the steps were forced and not excessively long (between 7 and 15 kilometers9, we really enjoyed our afternoons near the fire reading and resting.
